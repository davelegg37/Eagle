		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>The Eagle and The Crow</div>
		<div>Did you know that once a long time ago the eagle and the crow were physically very much a like? Psychologically and socially, however, the crow and the eagle have  always been very different birds. Their present day physical differences are a result of those interesting phenomenon in nature known as thermals. This is the tale of how the eagle became an eagle and the crow remained a crow.</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Psychologically crows are insecure birds and as a result they take few risks and need the constant reinforcement of others to combat their insecurity. They fly in great flocks from corn field to corn field in a never ending quest for secure of food supplies.</div>
		<div>When their bellies are full they congregate in rookeries, calling back and forth to one another for self assurance.</div>
		<div>The eagle is the psychological opposite of the crow. Eagles know exactly who they are and as a result they have the self confidence to be risk takers and loners.</div>
		<div>Long ago, however, it was hard to tell the eagles from the crows by just looking at them. What intervened to cause the vast difference between the present day eagles and crows was something called a thermal.          Thermals are those invisible elevators of warm air which birds use to soar effortlessly to heights they might not otherwise attain.</div>
		<div>When thermals first appeared the reaction of the the crows and eagles differed. Crows, with their eyes on corn fields and their attention directed toward the security of the rookery, saw thermals as a nuisance. The updrafts of the thermals made it hard to stay close to the corn field or to each other in their rookeries.</div>
		<div>Eagles, on the other hand, saw thermals as keys to freedom; freedom to break the bounds of earth's gravity, to experience the exhilaration of a world view.</div>
		<div>As time passed and eagles soared higher and higher they began to change, their wings grew larger, their eyes keener, but most of all their view of the world changed.</div>
		<div>They no longer saw just the trees, as did their cousins the crows, but experienced the wonderment and beauty of the whole forest. They were able to escape the confining view of the self and experience a cosmic view of the whole. Eagles soared in every sense of the word.</div>
		<div>Crows, preoccupied with their psychic and physical security, never appreciated the potential of the thermals. Afraid to risk the insecurity of the heights they remained clustered in the security of their corn fields and rookeries, their bellies always full and their psyches always pampered. They were, however, never able to experience awe and wonderment, the world in which the eagle soared.                                                        The End</div>
